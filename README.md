Concept
----------
Nearby Shops is an easy to use local e-commerce platform. Create your local market ... deliver fruits & Vegetables, food, flowers or anything else from your local stores.

You no longer need million dollar investment to start your local e-commerce business. Nearby Shops helps you start your local e-commerce business in extremely low budget. 

In the new emerging world, customers are getting tired of going outside the home to shop every day. They would much prefer to simply place an order and have the products delivered to their home the same day. 

Conventional e-commerce has issues ... the delivery takes a long time and it's more difficult to trust unknown vendors whom you cannot see and meet. Local e-commerce solves these issues because delivery is faster and customers can reach out to the vendors easily.

Tech Stack and app Architecture
--------------------------------

Uses Android Jetpack and Google’s Recommended Architecture Patterns - Migration to MVVM is planned

Written in both Java and Kotlin : Migration to kotlin is planned and will be coming in near future

Built using Retrofit, Ok-HTTP, Picasso, Dagger, and the Mapbox Android SDK

User-Interface is made using the modular View-Holder Pattern which makes the UI blocks modular, easy to reuse, modify and understand.

The app uses Single Activity Architecture, where most of the screens are implemented as fragments and there are only 2-3 activities in the entire project.
