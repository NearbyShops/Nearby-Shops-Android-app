        You cannot have a sub Item Category Under a leaf node Item Category.
        But you can have Items placed under a Leaf Node Item Category.

    <!-- An Abstract Item Category can have only Sub Item Categories and cannot contain items under them. -->
    <string name="abstract_category_usage">
        Item Categories Marked as abstract cannot have Items placed under them.
        But they can have Sub Item Categories Under them.
        Consider An Example: You have an Item Category : Groceries.
        You may not want to add / place items directly under Item Category : Groceries.
        You may want to create sub Item Categories like Dairy\, Shampoo\, Soap under Groceries and then add items under these categories.
        If i add item \"Milk\" directly under Groceries that will not make sense, but if i add \"Milk\" under Dairy that will make more sense.
        There are certain Item Categories which doesn\'t need to contain Items placed directly under them and you will want to make it abstract.
        Making the Item Categories as Abstract will protect / prevent someone from placing items directly under it.</string>
